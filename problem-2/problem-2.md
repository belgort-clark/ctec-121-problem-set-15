- Fill in your name at the top of the program.

Write a program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and the room numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (key) | Room Number (value) |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| CS101               | 3004                |
| CS102               | 4501                |
| CS103               | 6755                |
| NT110               | 1244                |
| CM241               | 1411                |

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the names of the instructors that teach each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (key) | Instructor (value) |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| CS101               | Haynes             |
| CS102               | Alvarado           |
| CS103               | Rich               |
| NT110               | Burke              |
| CM241               | Lee                |

The program should also create a dictionary containing course numbers and the meeting times of each course. The dictionary should have the following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (key) | Meeting Time (value) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| CS101               | 8:00 am              |
| CS102               | 9:00 am              |
| CS103               | 10:00 am             |
| NT110               | 11:00 am             |
| CM241               | 1:00 pm              |

The program should let the user enter a course number, and then it should display the courseâ€™s room number, instructor, and meeting time.
